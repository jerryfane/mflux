# mflux PR docs

Write the PR body for the current branch. The developer must approve the body before it goes to GitHub.

## Inputs

- The current branch. The base branch is `main`.
- Optional: the PR number, if the PR is open.

## Steps

1. Collect the facts. Use only these sources:
   - `git log --oneline main..HEAD`
   - `git diff --stat main...HEAD`
   - `git diff main...HEAD`
   - If the PR is open: `gh pr view <n> --json title,body,closingIssuesReferences` and `gh pr checks <n>`.
2. Copy `.github/pull_request_template.md` to `tmp-PR-content.md`. If `tmp-PR-content.md` exists, ask the developer before you replace it.
   - Add this heading as the first line: `# Draft PR Content`.
   - If the PR is open, `gh pr edit --body-file` replaces the existing body. Copy each existing section and link that the template does not have into `tmp-PR-content.md`. Get them from the `body` field of step 1. If you do not copy them, ask the developer to confirm before you discard them.
3. Write the `What` section. Obey `pr-what-prompt.md` in this folder. Use the diff from step 1 if the PR is not open. Add `Fixes #<n>` for each linked issue.
4. Write the release note. Obey `release-note-prompt.md` in this folder.
   - Put the note on the lines below the opening fence. Do not put text on the fence line.
   - Tell the developer which PR label the PR needs.
5. Write the `Verification` section. List only the commands that ran, with the result of each command. If no command ran, write `TODO: add the commands that you ran.` Do not write a result that you did not see.
6. Do not tick the boxes in the `Checklist` section. The developer ticks them.
7. Examine the text that you wrote. Do not examine the template text.
   - Apply the `asd-ste100` skill in STE-flavored mode.
   - Put the text that you wrote in a temporary file. Run `python3 .cursor/skills/asd-ste100/scripts/ste-lint.py <file>`.
   - Fix each hard violation.
8. Run the CI check on `tmp-PR-content.md`. Fix `tmp-PR-content.md` until the check passes:
   ```sh
   python3 - tmp-PR-content.md <<'PY'
   import re, sys
   body = open(sys.argv[1], newline="").read()
   m = re.search(r"^```release-note[ \t\r]*\n(.*?)^```[ \t\r]*$", body, re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE | re.MULTILINE)
   sys.exit(0 if m and m.group(1).strip() else "FAIL: no complete release-note block")
   PY
   ```
9. Ask the developer to approve the PR content:
   - Open `tmp-PR-content.md` in the editor. Use `code tmp-PR-content.md` or `cursor tmp-PR-content.md`. If neither command works, give the developer the file path.
   - Tell the developer to edit the file in the editor, or to ask for changes in the chat.
   - Tell the developer to write `approve` in the chat when the content is ready.
   - Do not continue until the developer writes `approve`.
10. Read `tmp-PR-content.md` again after the developer approves it. The developer can edit the file before approval. Do step 8 again.
11. Send the PR content to GitHub:
    - Delete the `# Draft PR Content` heading line from `tmp-PR-content.md`. GitHub must not get this heading.
    - If the PR is not open, push the branch first. Ask for permission before you push. Obey the `mflux-pr` skill. Then run `gh pr create --body-file tmp-PR-content.md`.
    - If the PR is open: `gh pr edit <n> --body-file tmp-PR-content.md`.
12. Delete `tmp-PR-content.md`.

## Rules

- Do not invent facts, numbers or test results.
- Do not change the code or the commits.
- Do not use `gh pr create --body` or `--fill`. GitHub must get the same body that you checked.
- Keep the regex in step 8 the same as `.github/workflows/release-note.yml` and `_FENCE` in `src/mflux/release/release_notes.py`.
